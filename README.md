# SuperHeroes-Source
A SuperHeroes mod for Source engine titles. (Built off the idea of the CS 1.6 mod)

Description: SuperHeroes-Source is a set of plugin modules for the Source Engine allow clients to pick and choose from multiple classes/heroes which give special perks, abilities and powerups each. The aim of this project is to replicate the CS 1.6 mod which was one of the reasons this project was commissioned for. The set is modularized so you can add to it, customize it and make your own sets of heroes, abilities and levels of progression.

Note: This mod is still under development, nothing's done yet. Bugs will be discovered and if you find any, post them as an issue here and I'll take a look. I'm also accepting push requests if anybody wants to contribute to this project.
