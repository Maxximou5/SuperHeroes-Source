Bug report for SuperHero-Mod:

General:
1. Need to be admin to choose heroes.
2. When using a power e.g +Streamline you press once and it shoots a Streamline then it stays until you press again. It should be toggled when you press down the button and disappear when you release the button.
3. Heroes are not working. Says "You are currently not this Hero".
4. Binding powers should be easier. Like "Bind Mouse3 +POWER1" +POWER2, +POWER3.
5. After you have chosen a Hero they should disappear from the menu list.
6. When joining the server you start at level 1, but can't reach level 2 since the required xp on level 1 is 0/0.
7. The ability to choose the same here multiple times should not be possible. This bug is linked to bug number 5.
8. Chosen heroes not saved after disconnect.
9. Wanted command: sm_setlevel <player> <level>
 


Hero testing:
1. Batgirl:
- When using the Streamline the movement speed should be at least 4 times as fast.
- There would be nice with a hooking sound.

2. Dracula:
- Not stealing any health from enemies.

3. Cyclops:
- Power not working. Nothing happens when using +ShootLasers.

4. Flash: (Nothing Major)
- Should maybe be just a little bit slower?
- Feels like the jump is speeded up, can it be changed somehow?

5. Hulk:
- Power not working, nothing happening.

- Sometimes gives you error "Your hero ability is currently on cooldown: 20", rejoining the server solves this issue and then the same as 1st bug on this ulk "..nothing happening."

6. Invisible Man: (Major problem)
- Getting major errors multiple times (about 200 times a second) in console which slows server. Message:
"L 08/29/2015 - 21:34:37: [SM] Native "GetEntPropEnt" reported: Property "m_hDisguiseWeapon" not found (entity 1/player)
L 08/29/2015 - 21:34:37: [SM] Displaying call stack trace for plugin "Hero_Invisibleman.smx":

7. Mystique: (Major problem)
- Power not working, crashes server, and replies with error (in server console): 
"1/ - player:  UTIL_SetModel:  not precached: models/player/ct_urban.mdl"
- And gives back an "Engine Error" window. Which is specified in "Engine Error.png"

8. Naruto:
- Power not working, nothing happening.

9. Nightcrawler:
- Should be a lot slower, like half the speed.
- Should be slayed if stuck in a wall. (Otherwise good input with getting teleported back to start position, maybe use it with another hero somehow?)

10. Sandman:
- Power not working, nothing happening.
- Chosing sandman while already having flash equipped will make you have to rechoose flash in order for his speed to work.
- Sometimes gives you error "Your hero ability is currently on cooldown: 15", rejoining the server solves this issue and then the same as 1st bug on this Sandman "..nothing happening."

11. Spiderman:
- Chosing Spiderman while already having flash equipped will make you have to rechoose flash in order for his speed to work.
- Web graphics working but movements is currently very messy.
- Should use the same graphics as batgirl instead of current.

12. Suicide Bomber:
- Not exploding when dying.

13. Sylar:
- Not giving any health when killing enemies.

14. Torch:
- Power not working, nothing happens.
